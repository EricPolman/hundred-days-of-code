# #ThirtyDaysOfCode

This is my attempt at doing a #ThirtyDaysOfCode challenge. My submissions will be experiments across the stack, all using TypeScript. This will likely include Angular, React, React Native, and NestJS. The submissions are generally focused on the code, not so much on the presentation.

The goal of this challenge is to explore new libraries, strengthen my TypeScript skills, build a better GitHub profile, and rediscover programming as a hobby. I initially started this as a "#HundredDaysOfCode" challenge, but quickly noticed that I started to enjoy it less. 100 days is a lot and it starts to become a chore. I think 30 days is achievable and less exhausting. I do plan to try more 30-day challenges, but focused on different subjects, like design, final touches, pretty demo's.
