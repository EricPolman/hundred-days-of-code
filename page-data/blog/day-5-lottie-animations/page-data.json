It is a package developed by AirBnB to play After Effects animations on web, mobile, and Windows. I never took the time to try it out, so I figured it was a good idea to try it out here. The goal of today is to setup a very small app containing several Lottie animations from <a href=\"https://lottiefiles.com/\">LottieFiles</a>.</p>\n<h2>Result</h2>\n<p>Today's result is a basic website that loads weather data for your current location via OpenWeather API. It parses the weather icon string in the response and looks up a corresponding Lottie animation to show. You can change the animation being shown by clicking a weather type in the side nav. There is also a basic loading animation using Lottie.</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ericpolman/git/pp/thirty-days-of-code/submissions/day-005-lottie/README.md","frontmatter":{"date":"May 02, 2020","path":"/blog/day-5-lottie-animations","title":"Day 5: Lottie animations"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
