# Day 1: React Hooks - Basic usage

Today I experimented with Hooks with the help of a PluralSight course (https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/using-react-hooks/table-of-contents). Normally, I prefer class-based components but this course opened my eyes to how much Hooks can simplify components.

Having explored several of the basic hooks, I'm now eager to learn how they work behind the scenes and how I can setup hooks myself (and combining them), which will likely be explored tomorrow.

Unfortunately due to the nature of this day's subject, there isn't a fancy demo apart from some of the course work.
