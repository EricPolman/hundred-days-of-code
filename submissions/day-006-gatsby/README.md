# Day 6: Gatsby - Static Site Generation

## Introduction

At this moment, I don't really have a personal website / portfolio other than a blog that was last updated when I was still in collegâ‰¥. My submissions for the #thirtydaysofcode challenge include READMEs that are actually small blog posts. It makes sense to turn these submissions into something I can put on my personal website and Gatsby seems to be a great tool to accomplish that.

Today I will setup a small static blog website using Gatsby and the READMEs included in every day's submission (including this one!).
