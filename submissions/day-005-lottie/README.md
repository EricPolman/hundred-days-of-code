# Day 5: Lottie animations

## Introduction

During my development on React Native apps, I came across Lottie. It is a package developed by AirBnB to play After Effects animations on web, mobile, and Windows. I never took the time to try it out, so I figured it was a good idea to try it out here. The goal of today is to setup a very small app containing several Lottie animations from [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/).

## Result
