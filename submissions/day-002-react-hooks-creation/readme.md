# Day 2: React Hooks - Creation (Dark Mode hook)

Today I am diving deeper into how Hooks work and am following a tutorial for setting up a hook for toggling an app between dark mode and light mode. ([Tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAf0uhKVHBk&feature=youtu.be))

For an explanation on how hooks work behind the scenes, [this article](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/03/11/deep-dive-how-do-react-hooks-really-work/) explains it very well. [The talk](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/react-hooks/) dives even deeper. It boils down to closure usage (a topic to dive further into) and making sure you call hooks in the same order every time you render a component.
